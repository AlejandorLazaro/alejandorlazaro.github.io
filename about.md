# About Me

![If I ever made an album cover](/assets/img/album.jpg)

On December 25th, 1999 I received my very first game console - a Nintendo 64 with A Bug's Life and Toy Story 2. From then on, I grew up with and learned to love video games as a story-telling medium. It became my goal to someday also share the excitement and wonder of being able to transport yourself into a living story with others one day, and that's why I'm now a Game Producer!

I grew up a Nintendo fanboy - Mario, Pok√©mon, and Link were my bygone heroes taking up schoolday afternoons.
