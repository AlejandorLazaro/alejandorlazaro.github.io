    <div class="title">The Journey from Player to Producer</div>
    <div class="bio">
        From receiving my first Nintendo 64 at age 6 to producing games professionally, my path has been driven by a passion for interactive storytelling and helping development teams create amazing experiences. Here's how I got here.

            <p>On December 25th, 1999, when I was 6 years old, I received my very first game consoleâ€”a <span class="highlight">Nintendo 64 with A Bug's Life and Toy Story 2</span>. From then on, I grew up with and learned to love video games as a story-telling medium. It became my goal to someday also share the excitement and wonder of being able to transport yourself into a living story with others one day, and that's why I'm now a <span class="highlight">Game Producer!</span></p>

            <p>Starting off learning Game Development during my undergraduate studies at <span class="highlight">LeTourneau University</span>, I was eager and excited to learn how to make the games I loved! In Winter 2014, I graduated with a Computer Science degree with dual concentrations in Game Development and Network Security, but wasn't yet confident in my ability to contribute as a game programmer. I looked up graduate programs (including SMU Guildhall) and applied to every programming company I could think of. All while learning Python to fill in my scripting language knowledge gap to help interview without having to type "public static void main" every time I went up to a whiteboard.</p>

            <p>Two months after graduation and two weeks of phone and on-site interviews later, I was accepted into <span class="highlight">Apple</span> as an <span class="highlight">iOS Automation Software Engineer</span>. And yes, there were many Beer Bashes. ðŸ¤Ÿ (I got to see Demi Lovato and Lady Gaga ðŸ™€)</p>

            <p>Over the course of 7-and-a-half years, I learned a lot about how to be a good engineer, but more importantly, I learned how to help others and have fun in new and challenging spaces! After COVID-19 hit, I had 2 years of remote work to start reflecting on where I really wanted to be. I looked back at <span class="highlight">SMU Guildhall</span> and applied for their graduate program as a Producer to see if I could take on the vital role of helping developers of all disciplines be as productive as they can be.</p>

            <p>After being accepted into Guildhall's Cohort 32 in Fall of 2022, I got to experience the pleasure and hardship that 50 other students had while journeying through a breakneck course to prepare us all for the real world of game development. Through the curriculum, we managed to ship two titles to Steam: <span class="highlight">SeaFeud</span> and <span class="highlight">Asurya's Embers</span>! I'd be lying if I said it wasn't hard in many ways, and I dearly miss those who didn't finish the journey, but as I continue going forward I find myself anticipating the next growth opportunity to prepare for a future in game development.</p>

            <p>In October of 2024, I joined Stray Kite Studios as a producer to help ship their first title: <span class="highlight">Wartorn</span>! After a few months of breakneck work, we  released on Steam Next Fest 2025 and Early Access on June 17th. Throughout that time, I got to enjoy learning more than I'd ever thought possible about different game development disciplines, practices, and more... <i>including</i> the fact that Unreal has a Python API!</p>
            <br>
            <p>During my tenure, I learned to leverage my previous software engineering and automation experience to create tons of dev tools/scripts to help design, localization, and marketing make and record changes for our game patch updates! You can see many of the learnings and tools I wound up making during my time at Stray Kite Studios via the Notion link below.

            <p><strong>Production Philosophy:</strong> I believe great games come from empowered teams. My role is to remove obstacles, streamline workflows, and create environments where creativity can flourish.</p>

            <p><strong>Technical Approach:</strong> With my engineering background, I focus on automating repetitive tasks and building tools that let developers focus on what they do best. If I can write a script to do it, I will.</p>

            <p><strong>Team Collaboration:</strong> Having worked across disciplinesâ€”from iOS engineering to game productionâ€”I understand the unique challenges each role faces and how to facilitate better communication between teams.</p>

            <p><strong>Continuous Learning:</strong> The game industry evolves rapidly, and I'm committed to staying current with new tools, methodologies, and technologies that can benefit our development process.</p>
