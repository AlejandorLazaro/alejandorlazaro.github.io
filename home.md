    <div class="bio">
        On December 25th, 1999, I received my very first game console - a Nintendo 64 with A Bug's Life and Toy Story 2. From then on, I grew up with and learned to love video games as a story-telling medium. It became my goal to someday share the excitement and wonder of being able to transport yourself into a living story with others, and that's why I'm now a <span class="highlight">Game Producer</span>!

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Growing up as a Nintendo fanboy, Mario, Pok√©mon, and Link were my heroes taking up schoolday afternoons. This passion for interactive storytelling naturally evolved into a career in game production.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I believe in the power of games to create meaningful experiences and transport players into living stories. My focus is on bringing teams together to craft these memorable journeys.</p>
