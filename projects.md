Ludum Jam 23 - Back in 2012, I took part in the Ludum Jam for Tiny World, where [Tangent128](https://github.com/Tangent128) and I both worked to make a one-screen Zelda-like game. The result looked somewhat pretty, with Perlin noise randomly generated overworld maps, all done using [Fossil](http://fossil-scm.org) and a custom JavaScript engine. Sadly, we never got around to finishing our boss combat or implementing a death sequence, but for my first major game jam, it was exciting to say the least!
